<title>RECYCLE MORE</title>
<h1>Recycling</h1>
<p> We need to recycle more since tonnes of plastic every year, (8 million </p>
<p>metric tons of plastics) enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric </p>
<p>tons that currently circulate our marine environments. This Is very bad since </p>
<p>thousands of animals in the sea do suffer in plastic and sadly die  remember they </p>
<p>have feelings too fishes suffer from this </p>
<p></p>
<p>It also pollutes our earth and makes the air we breathe in worst for us and other </p>
<p>animals pollution is also a big problem as we re cutting down trees which produce </p>
<p>oxygen for us to breathe in </p>
<h1>Reasons why you should recycle</h1>
<p>It saves you money on buying other things tyres and playground equipment or shirts, </p>
<p>plastic bottles, shirts and moreâ€¦</p>
<h1>CLEAN UP</h1>
<p>Next time you go to the beach try to help with the cleaning if you see any plastic lying</p>
<p>about out it in a recycling bin or keep it </p>
<h1>WATER</h1>
<p>The water we drink will no longer be clean and will ruin our economy since in like </p>
<p>africa there water causes many diseases so we should not chuck away any of our </p>
<p>plastic </p>
