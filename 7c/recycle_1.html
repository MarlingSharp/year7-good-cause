        <p>Recycling is the process of reusing items in an inventive way</p>

        <h1>WHY YOU SHOULD RECYCLE</h1>
        <p>
            Global environmental hazards to our environment include climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion,
            changes in ecosystems due to loss of biodiversity, changes in hydrological systems and the supplies of
            freshwater, land degradation, urbanization, and stresses on food-producing systems.
            This could eventually lead to catastrophic consequences for the environment and the general world. This is
            why we must all start recycling!</p>
        <p>
            Recycling is very important as waste has a huge negative impact on the natural environment. Harmful
            chemicals and greenhouse gasses are released from rubbish in landfill sites. Recycling helps to reduce the
            pollution caused by waste. ... Recycling reduces the need for raw materials so that the rainforests can be
            preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            By being smarter about recycling, we can cut down on the amount of rubbish be bury in the ground, or burn
            just to get rid of it. Recycling is important. Recycling means we can make new products cheaper. It also
            means that we cause fewer greenhouse gasses, and millions of tonnes less waste to landfill.
