            You should always wear sunscreen outside when it is sunny to protect you from the UV rays that can harm you badly. In the picture above it shows an estimated representation of a UV ray harming a human. Although, it shouldn't harm her as she is putting on sunscreen but in the picture she doesn't seem like she isn't putting on enough. UV RAYS can cause skin cancer. You can never just â€œcan't be bothered because it is very dangerous if you  don't. It wont protect all of you though, you need to wear suitable clothing.
