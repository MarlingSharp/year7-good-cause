<h2>Messaging services</h2>
Messaging services like Whatsapp, Messages from Apple or Samsung and even Discord can help you keep in touch with loved ones and friends and are really helpful when it comes to contacting people when far away, but can make bullying worse as the bully cannot see the victim and cannot know how emotionally hurt the victim is and so they may carry on bullying the victim.

<h2>Video calling</h2>
Video calling services like Google Meet, Zoom and Facetime can be really helpful in seeing and interacting with loved ones and friends especially during the pandemic that we are in right now but can be a hard job setting up first time and can be awkward if you are not expecting one and are occupied.
