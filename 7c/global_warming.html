        <p>
            Here are a few things you can do to contribute to stopping global warming.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk more often, and drive less</li>
            <li>Stop smoking and releasing unnecessary fumes into the atmosphere </li>
            <li>Do more exercise and less being lazy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Any of the above will help put a stop to global warming so act now while you can and make a difference to
            our world and forever ban global warming. However it's not quite as easy as it seems. Hundreds of companies
            around the world use factories for mass production therefore realising dangerous fumes into the atmosphere
            so we have to take a risk.
            Do we act against global warming and lose businesses,s
            Or do we do nothing about it and keep companies that poison the world
            I think we should act while we can and take the risk because therefore we can carry on living.
        </p>

        <p>
            Do you want the world to look like this
            Do you want to live in a world of death and pollution
            No, well then act and make a difference. “There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than at any
            point in the last 800,000 year”.
