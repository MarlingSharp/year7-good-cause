<h1>Xbox vs Playstation</h1>

<p>The war between these two amazing consoles has been raging for some time. On one hand the Playstation [aka the ps] has higher selling rates than the Xbox however the Xbox premium is just better than the Playstations. As well as that, the Xbox ones prices are largely lower than the Playstation 4 at £249.99 whereas the PlayStation 4 is £299.99.</p>

<p>But today we are going to be talking about two massive tech giants that were just released recently. First we have one that loads of people love (it's made by Microsoft), it is the Xbox Series X. Next up we have the other huge giant, loved by millions, it’s made by Sony and has a recurring theme in the name it is the Playstation 5.</p>

XBOX SERIES X                  PLAYSTATION 5              
                                                              
UK price = £499.99                                                                   UK price = £449
FPS = 120                                                                                    FPS = 120
Storage = 802 GB+ expandable S                                           Storage = 667.2 GB         

The Xbox community loves the Xbox products as much as the PlayStation community loves the PlayStation products. Though they cost quite a bit, this can make the perfect Christmas present or Birthday present ever. These consoles are mostly for gamers but are great for the ordinary community as well. 

Pros for the PS5:                                      Pros for the Xbox Series X
-Cost  £50 less                                           -138.8 GB more storage
-Sold 4.6 million units                                 -Expandable storage


                                                      Pros  for both consoles  
                                    -Same amount of FPS per second (120 FPS)  
                     
                 
<h2>Information from The Sun</h2>

<p>In conclusion to this, we would rather not choose a side and instead let you decide which console is better. Both consoles have their own pros and cons, however are not perfect yet. We have listed the pros and cons of both consoles and believe that they are good in their own ways. Either way you will spend your money well.</p>
