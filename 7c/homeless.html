        <h2>What is the problem?</h2>

        <p>
            It’s unfair that they don't get the same opportunities that we do because really, we are all the same and
            deserve to have the same things in life.</p>
        <p>
            It’s unhuman of us to stand and watch other people suffering.Step up help them, offer them some food maybe
            help them find a home because that could change their lives.</p>



        <p>
            There are hundreds of homeless shelters over the world that have been set up by the kind-hearted people who
            want to make a difference in the world.

        <p>
            A home like this is vital for the homeless.
        </p>




        <h2>But why should we help them?</h2>

        <p>
            The homeless are also people, but just more unfortunate but i'm sure that if they were more fortunate, they
            would help you! I think that if you think that they wouldn’t feel better with a home, then that is just
            cruel.

        <h2>Would YOU like to lose your home?</h2>

        <p>
            I know that it's unlikely that you will go homeless but just think, what if you lost your home, your
            friends, your family, your hope?
        </p>
        <p>NO! You wouldn’t like that!</p>
