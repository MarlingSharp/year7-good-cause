        <p>You’ve seen it all before. Save the oceans! But… nobody does anything. People see documentaries, online
            adverts, & even posters like this one. But they soon forget. Make a real change & protect the marine life.
            Companies compete over what should be changed: greenhouse gases, extinction, climate change, & plastics.
            Instead of arguing, we should sort out the problems, one at a time, starting with oceans. Turtles eat
            jellyfish as their natural food. Every year, over 76% of all turtles eat at least thirty plastic bags each
            because they have been thrown into the sea. In one month, 58 million fish have got caught in plastic. Half
            of those fish die.</p>

        <p>And not just plastics! Fishermen hunt and harpoon whales for no reason. In China, (damn corona virus) sharks
            have their fins cut off to make soup. Then the sharks are released back into the ocean, finless, and unable
            to swim, they slowly die.</p>

        <p>
            Every year, 12 million metric tons of plastic is manufactured. If you live near a beach, go litterpicking
            along the shore for plastics. Do not let this happen ->
            Join an organisation, like Ocean Conservancy, or Oceana to make a real difference.
        </p>

        <p>
            100 million marine lives die from plastic every year, and many more are hunted to extinction. There are 705,
            000 tons of discarded fishing nets in the ocean that can trap, injure and even kill sharks, dolphins, sea
            lions and turtles. A lesser known ocean animal, the manatee, (otherwise known as a sea cow) is almost
            extinct ; the parents are killed by humans and predators eat the babys.
