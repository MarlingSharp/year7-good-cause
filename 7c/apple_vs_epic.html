            Fortnite got banned from Apple's App Store and people need to (not really fight) but we need to fight for it
            to come back.

        <p>
            A bit of back story. Epic games defied the app stores code of conduct in retaliation apple blocked fortnite
            from around a billion devices.

            Come on people, Apple took at least 30% of the prophet's epic games made from fortnite. Surely if Apple
            didn’t want this to happen they would have taken less of their money. I think it’s fair that epic games can
            make a direct payment to epic games and it would be cheaper for people. I agree that fortnite can be a game
            that apple doesn’t take money from.

            Apple should be more aware of how much money they are taking from epic games/ fortnite.

            One recent triumph for fortnite is the nvidia gaming cloud which after Christmas 2020 you will be able to
            play fortnite on it. But the one problem is that with a free membership you can only play for 1 hour a day.
            Which is probably making parents be very happy because you can’t play long but it’s still playing isn’t it.
            Another good reason to have it is that you can play any game in that hour a day!
