        <p>In the recent times of gaming, a number of hacks have been found in online games. These include flying,
            invincibility, one shot kills, and immediate items and prizes. They need to stop! Even with the large number
            of anti-hacks installed in some online games such as Minecraft servers, hackers and cheaters are sometimes
            able to still get through. This maybe because of the new PS5 and XBOX series X, as they both have better
            software, and therefore better and quicker hacking times and skills. </p>
        <p>
            With the release of murder-mystery game Among Us, cheaters have hacked the game to get endless Imposter or
            Crewmate, easy kills and wins, and unlocking co gets de smetics. In both games, the makers are trying to ban
            and find more cheaters and to stop hacking for ever.
