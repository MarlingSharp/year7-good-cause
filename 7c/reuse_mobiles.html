        <p>
            Every year, people throw away millions of mobile phones as most
            phones aren&#39;t built to last, and manufacturers are constantly
            encouraging us to buy new ones. But there are many ways to repair
            and reuse old phones in useful ways which will save you money too!

            For example, you could try turning your old mobile into a camera,
            perfect for taking pictures. Alternatively, you could turn it into
            an alarm clock to wake you up in the morning or even a TV remote if
            you have installed the correct apps!

            So, with that in mind, there are many ways to reuse your old phones
            in new and inventive ways. The mobile phone companies may perhaps
            encourage you to simply throw your old phone away, but in reality
            there are in fact many ways to reuse an old phone. Just be inventive
            and you&#39;ll find many uses for them!
