        <p>Water aid is a company that gives water to the people who don’t have any access to clean water.This water
            complies to having good hygiene, clean clothes, good toilet and drinking clean water. </p>

        Here’s a link to visit the water aid site.</p>

        Clean Water, Decent Toilets and Good Hygiene | WaterAid UK</p>

        Ethiopia is a very poor country so 50,000 people across it don’t have clean water. Same with Ethiopia, Eritrea
        only has 19.3% of their population having clean and suitable water services the other 80.7% lack basic water
        services. </p>


        Charity Water is a very similar charity to water aid and they are still pretty reliable when it comes to giving
        water to small countries.</p>

        <p>Here is three great water charities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water Aid</li>
            <li>Charity Water </li>
            <li>Generosity</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Most people think that the water charities are unreliable. However these charities are really reliable and
            can be counted on so please donate to any of these charities if possible you are making a difference.</p>
