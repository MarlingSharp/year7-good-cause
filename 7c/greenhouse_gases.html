<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Greenhouse gases are one of the worst things in the world. 
It cases the atmosphere to heat up and that causes a lot of different problems.</p>
<title>Types</title>
<h1>Water Vapour</h1>
<p>Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. It controls the Earth's temperature.</p>
<p>It's true that water vapor is the largest amount of gas in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Because these gases are not condensable at atmospheric </p>
<p>temperatures and pressures, the atmosphere can pack in much more of these gases.</p>
<h1>Carbon Dioxide</h1>
<p>Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. In</p>
<p>activities.</p>
<h1>Methane</h1>
<p>Of all the greenhouse gases, methane is one of the worst because of its ability to</p>
<p>take in heat.Over the years, it has been proven that a kilogram of methane warms</p>
<p>the planet 80 times more than a kilogram of carbon dioxide.</p>
<title>Why it's Bad</title>
<p>Greenhouse gases cause global warming by trapping heat in themselves and making the</p>
<p>environment hotter. They can also contribute to diseases from smog and air pollution.</p>
<p>Finally, it can also cause extreme weather, loss of food, increased wildfires, worse</p>
<p>hurricanes and glaciers melting.</p>
<h1>How to Stop it</h1>
<p>If you want to stop or decrease the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, follow</p>
<p>these five easy steps.</p>
<h1>1.Walk wherever you can</h1>
<h1>2.Don't smoke</h1>
<h1>3.Don't make campfires for fun</h1>
<h1>4.Use natural electricity</h1>
<h1>5.Only use recyclable materials</h1>
