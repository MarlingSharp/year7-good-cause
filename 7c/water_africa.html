<h1>The Benefits Of Water</h1>
<p>

Most people in England get clean water straight from the tap and it's always clean. Every single time. In Africa the potential threat in drinking water in some countries. 
</p>

<p>
The threat of drinking water in Africa is major. It can cause diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, polio and stomach aches.

<h1>How Clean Water Helps</h1>
<p>
Clean water helps people in LOADS of ways. It keeps them hydrated and makes them live longer because their body isn't flooded with dirty water. Clean water can help you become more hygenic. Here at Water For Africa we believe that everyone should have the right to drink CLEAN and SAFE WATER.

<h1>We Need Your Help</h1>
<p>
Over the last couple months, because of the Covid-19 pandemic we couldn’t fundraise. Even if we had the money we couldn’t ship the Clean water from England to Africa. The only reason we survived over this period was from YOUR donations. We could've never done it without you. That is why all the staff and volunteers and helpers have to say one thing to the people who donated.

<h1>THANK YOU!!!!</h1>
