        <p>
            It is important that we donâ€™t needlessly blame climate change. There have been many times in which the cause
            was undermined due to people saying it was climate change when it was something else. One example would be
            in California in which the suppression of fire has caused an overgrowth of flammable materials leading to
            the worst fires in centuries.

        <h2>Renewables</h2>
        <p>
            Offshore wind turbines would be important to society because with ever increasing land costs they would
            provide a way to create electricity cheaply so everyone would win, we would get energy and the suppliers
            would get money. However in order to achieve our goals we would rely on solar panels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Solar would be a great option because there are plenty of hot places on this earth to house the panels and
            poor countries would get rich with the money of the energy transportation.

        <h2>What about nuclear?</h2>
        <p>
            We could last 200 years with just known uranium and no plutonium or thorium reactors.
            Economically accessible uranium deposits and that's not considering specialized reactors.
